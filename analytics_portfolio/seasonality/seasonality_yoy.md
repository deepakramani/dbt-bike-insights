1. Revenue Performance & Growth Patterns
The company experienced exponential growth from 2010 to 2013, with total sales skyrocketing to $25.5M in 2013 (141% YoY growth). However, 2014 shows a dramatic decline to just $73K, indicating a major business disruption or incomplete data.
2. Product Category Evolution
The product mix has shifted significantly:

The business began primarily selling bikes (100% in 2010-2011)
Accessories became dominant by 2013, representing 77% of units sold
In 2014, the company sold only accessories with zero bike sales, suggesting a potential supply chain issue or strategic pivot

3. Customer Value Metrics

Average revenue per customer peaked at $1,464 in 2013
The customer base expanded dramatically in 2013 (436% growth to 17,429 customers)
Customer acquisition dropped sharply in 2014, signaling retention challenges

4. Seasonal Performance Patterns

December consistently performs as the highest revenue month
February shows as the weakest month, creating an opportunity for targeted promotions
Understanding this seasonality is critical for inventory planning and marketing initiatives

5. Strategic Recommendations
Based on these insights, I'd recommend:

Launching a customer win-back campaign targeting the 16,595 customers lost in 2014
Investigating supply chain issues affecting bike sales
Implementing seasonal inventory strategies to capitalize on Q4 demand
Developing a loyalty program to increase average items per customer
